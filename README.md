### To do list
- [x] Set Up the Project Structure
- [x] Create the main project folder
- [x] Create folders for each part of the dApp
- [x] Frontend Setup (React)
- [x] Initialize a React project in frontend
- [ ] Install necessary dependencies
- [ ] Set up basic folders for components and utilities
- [ ] Edit src/App.tsx to render the main component
- [ ] Eth Smart Contracts: Initialize a Hardhat project
- [ ] Install Solidity libraries
- [ ] Create contracts
- [ ] Compile contracts
- [ ] Solana Smart Contracts: Set up Solana environment
- [ ] Edit the Solana program in Rust, Build the program
- [ ] Backend Setup: Initialize Node.js project in backend
- [ ] Install essential dependencies
- [ ] Create core files and folders
- [ ] Set up an Express server in src/index.ts
- [ ] Run the backend server
- [ ] Integrate and Run the Project
- [ ] Connect the Frontend to Backend APIs for handling cross-chain payments
- [ ] Deploy and test Ethereum contracts on a testnet (like Goerli)
- [ ] Deploy Solana contracts to a Solana testnet (like Devnet)
- [ ] Start the Frontend server


### Overview
We’ll build a cross-chain dApp that has:<br />
-Frontend: Built with React, which will interact with the Ethereum and Solana networks.<br />
-Backend: Handles cross-chain communication and payment logic.<br />
-Smart Contracts: Written for both Ethereum (using Solidity) and Solana (using Rust).

### Prerequisites
-Node.js (at least v16.x or v18.x)<br />
-npm or yarn (for JavaScript dependencies)<br />
-Rust & Solana CLI (for Solana smart contract development)<br />
-Hardhat or Foundry (for Ethereum smart contract development)<br />
-Anchor (if using it to simplify Solana contract development)<br />
